# Mobile App Development 1 Final Project
 News App Project Submission

 
 
# App Introduction

The News App fetches news data from the News API, which provides access to news articles from various sources. The app presents the news articles to the user in an organized and easily accessible manner, with multiple catego-ries such as Business, Entertainment, General, Health, Science, Sports, and Technology. Users can easily switch between these categories and use the Search Bar to find news topics of their interest. Relevant news headlines are displayed in the app based on the searched keywords. Additionally, the app includes an "Open Google" button to allow users to search for more infor-mation outside of the app, in case they need to look up specific details or find answers to their questions that are not covered in the news articles within the app.


# App Development

The News App has been designed and developed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience to the users. To achieve this, the following features have been implemented:

#	Restful Android App
The News App is a Restful Android App that utilizes the News API provided by newsapi.org to fetch news data from various sources and presents them to the user in an organized and easily accessible manner.

#	Multiple Screens
The app consists of at least two screens (Activities) which allows the user to navigate between them seamlessly. The main screen displays the different categories of news available, and the second screen displays the news arti-cles.

#	Activity Lifecycle Management
The app ensures that the user's activity data is not lost during the activity lifecycle. For instance, when the user rotates the device from landscape to por-trait or navigates out and back in the app, the app retains the data entered by the user.

#	Localization
The app supports at least two languages, ensuring that users from different regions can enjoy the app without any language barrier. All the strings used in the app are localized and there are no hard-coded strings, making it easy to translate the app into other languages.

#	Implicit Intent
The app utilizes common implicit intents to provide a seamless experience for the user. For instance, the "Open Google" button allows users to browse the internet outside the app to get more information about a news topic.

These features make the News App stand out and provide a user-friendly ex-perience to the users.
