# App Introduction

The News App fetches news data from the News API, which provides access to news articles from various sources. The app presents the news articles to the user in an organized and easily accessible manner, with multiple catego-ries such as Business, Entertainment, General, Health, Science, Sports, and Technology. Users can easily switch between these categories and use the Search Bar to find news topics of their interest. Relevant news headlines are displayed in the app based on the searched keywords. Additionally, the app includes an "Open Google" button to allow users to search for more infor-mation outside of the app, in case they need to look up specific details or find answers to their questions that are not covered in the news articles within the app.
